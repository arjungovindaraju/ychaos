We invite participation from many people to bring different perspectives to our projects. We will do our part to foster a welcoming and professional environment free of harassment. We expect participants to communicate professionally and thoughtfully during their involvement with this project. Participants may lose their good standing by engaging in misconduct. For example: insulting, threatening, or conveying unwelcome sexual content. We ask participants who observe conduct issues to report the incident directly to the project's Response Team at opensource-conduct@verizonmedia.com . Yahoo will assign a respondent to address the issue. We may remove harassers from this project. This code does not replace the terms of service or acceptable use policies of the websites used to support this project. We acknowledge that participants may be subject to additional conduct terms based on their employment which may govern their online expressions. Details \u00b6 This Code of Conduct makes our expectations of participants in this community explicit. * We forbid harassment and abusive speech within this community. * We request participants to report misconduct to the project\u2019s Response Team. * We urge participants to refrain from using discussion forums to play out a fight. Expected Behaviors \u00b6 We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issues, pull requests, comments, emails, or chats) devoid of vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is important that participants are attentive to their interaction style. Assume positive intent. We ask community members to assume positive intent on the part of other people\u2019s communications. We may disagree on details, but we expect all suggestions to be supportive of the community goals. Respect participants. We expect occasional disagreements. Open Source projects are learning experiences. Ask, explore, challenge, and then respectfully state if you agree or disagree. If your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter. Welcoming to new members. New members bring new perspectives. Some ask questions that have been addressed before. Kindly point to existing discussions. Everyone is new to every project once. Be kind to beginners. Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to engage kindly. Consider your impact on others. Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest. Use words carefully. We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. Often, people will misinterpret sarcasm in online communications. We ask community members to communicate plainly. Leave with class. When you wish to resign from participating in this project for any reason, you are free to fork the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly allows this. Your exit should not be dramatic or bitter. Unacceptable Behaviors \u00b6 Participants remain in good standing when they do not engage in misconduct or harassment (some examples follow). We do not list all forms of harassment, nor imply some forms of harassment are not worthy of action. Any participant who feels harassed or observes harassment, should report the incident to the Response Team. * Don't be a bigot. Calling out project members by their identity or background in a negative or insulting manner. This includes, but is not limited to, slurs or insinuations related to protected or suspect classes e.g. race, color, citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features, language, profession, national minority status, mental or physical ability. * Don't insult. Insulting remarks about a person\u2019s lifestyle practices. * Don't dox. Revealing private information about other participants without explicit permission. * Don't intimidate. Threats of violence or intimidation of any project member. * Don't creep. Unwanted sexual attention or content unsuited for the subject of this project. * Don't inflame. We ask that victim of harassment not address their grievances in the public forum, as this often intensifies the problem. Report it, and let us address it off-line. * Don't disrupt. Sustained disruptions in a discussion. Reporting Issues \u00b6 If you experience or witness misconduct, or have any other concerns about the conduct of members of this project, please report it by contacting our Response Team at opensource-conduct@verizonmedia.com who will handle your report with discretion. Your report should include: * Your preferred contact information. We cannot process anonymous reports. * Names (real or usernames) of those involved in the incident. * Your account of what occurred, and if the incident is ongoing. Please provide links to or transcripts of the publicly available records (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), so that we can review it. * Any additional information that may be helpful to achieve resolution. After filing a report, a representative will contact you directly to review the incident and ask additional questions. If a member of the Yahoo Response Team is named in an incident report, that member will be recused from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the Response Team, it will be addressed by a different member of the Response Team. We will consider reports to be confidential for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. Scope \u00b6 Yahoo will assign a Response Team member with admin rights on the project and legal rights on the project copyright. The Response Team is empowered to restrict some privileges to the project as needed. Since this project is governed by an open source license, any participant may fork the code under the terms of the project license.

Include documentation to the code added using the Google docstrings format. Commit the file and include a meaningful name to the commit. If the changes to the code are more than huge, it is advised to split the commits into multiple. How to run Screwdriver validations locally? \u00b6 Note If you have installed the development package with debug extension, then all of these packages required for screwdriver validations will already be installed in your virtual environment. To run all the code analysis steps locally run make build . To run unittests locally, run make test . Coding standards \u00b6 This section of the document contains some of the coding standards followed in this package. It is recommended to read this and follow this for any contribution. This section of the document provides some of the preferred ways of writing code. Although, most of the subsections are provided with reasoning, this is not an official coding standard and can vary in special conditions. Hint Note that this is a constantly updating section of the document and will receive more items based on our experience. Imports \u00b6 Importing class \u00b6 If you are importing a class from a module, then import only the class from the module instead of importing the entire module. For example: Preferred from pathlib import Path mock_path = Path ( \"/home/awesomeuser/mockdirectory\" ) Avoid import pathlib mock_path = pathlib . Path ( \"/home/awesomeuser/mockdirectory\" ) Importing attributes/methods from module \u00b6 In case you want to import a method or an attribute from the module, whose name starts with a small alphabet, then import the module instead of method or attribute. Reasoning : If the module under change already has a variable named same as method/attribute, this will make you do an extra work of renaming all of those variables. For example: Preferred import os print ( os . cpu_count ()) Avoid from os import cpu_count print ( cpu_count ()) @staticmethod vs @classmethod \u00b6 We generally use class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return classobject (similar to a constructor) for different use cases. We generally use static methods to create utility functions. One Line if statements \u00b6 Use one line if statements if there is an else block defined and has some piece of code. If the else block just contains None , use a simple if statement Preferred if True : sum ([ 1 , 4 , - 3 , 19 ]) Avoid sum ([ 12 , 4 , - 3 , 10 ]) if True else None Path operations \u00b6 Use pathlib for path operation instead of os.path as this has better methods of operating on path.

You can start with YChaos here I am a YChaos user \u00b6 What version of YChaos should I install? \u00b6 It is always recommended to install the latest version(PATCH) of YChaos for the chaos testing. Although we test the package thoroughly for each PATCH update, there might be unknown regressions/bugs introduced in the new PATCH versions. To avoid this, you can install the latest MINOR version. I am running YChaos and ... \u00b6 The console is not able to emit control codes and ended up printing gibberish \u00b6 It seems the console you are running the CLI is not interactive. To disable interactive mode, in YChaos CLI output, set the TERM environment variable to \"dumb\"/\"unknown\". This will disable features that require movement of cursor. Example: TERM = unknown ychaos validate testplan_folder/ You can also disable the colors emitted by the YChaos CLI by either setting NO_COLOR environment variable or calling YChaos CLI with --no-color . Example: The two commands mentioned below are equivalent. NO_COLOR = true ychaos validate testplan_folder/ ychaos --no-color validate testplan_folder/ I am a YChaos Contributor \u00b6 I do not like the way something is coded in this package. How do I bring the attention of this to the maintainers? \u00b6 Its not wrong to design things better than they are right now. Create a Github issue explaining what you do not like and how you would change it. If the change is approved, you can always contribute to the repository. We would likely not make this change to the repo. This is the same for suggesting adding a new feature to YChaos. Discuss and contribute. In the case of new features, we might actually contribute if its worthwhile. How do I add a new optional 3 rd party package to the tool. \u00b6 Discuss the usecase you are trying to solve by creating a Github issue with us. Once approved to add new package to the repository, add the package at the right place in setup.cfg . install_requires are the list of PyPi packages that are installed by default. options.extras_require are the optional dependencies that contains subpackages and also dev packages. How do I run a single Unittest from command line? \u00b6 We recommend you to use an IDE for development. (Preferably PyCharm) which will provide you the feature of running a single unittest suite or a single test out of the box. If you still like to run it via command line you can use the below command. pytest <TEST_SUITE> -k \"<TEST_NAME>\" For example, pytest tests/test_settings.py -k \"test_settings_with_no_config_creates_ProdSettings_configuration\" I am a YChaos Maintainer \u00b6 When do I need to release new minor versions? \u00b6 New subcommand is added to YChaos CLI * Backward incompatible testplan New Verification Plugin * New YChaos Agent * Backward incompatible CLI changes (Arguments etc.) For the items marked with *, the PR with the changes can go in first and a new patch release can be released. After that, the package can be bumped to new minor version. For the items without *, the changes and the new version should go in as a same release. A patch version with this update should not be released. How do I release a backward incompatible YChaos Testplan? \u00b6 Its always ideal to keep the testplan backward compatible as much as possible. This may not possible based on the new usecases coming in. All the changes that break the current setup should be part of one Pull Request. The PR owner should also update the minor version of the package in this PR. A new minor version should be released upon merging this PR. Do I need to release all the commits as a new patch version? \u00b6 Yes. This is part of the repository pipeline and this behaviour should not be changed. Every single commit, should automatically release a new version of the package.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq-frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"FAQ (Frequently Asked questions)"},{"location":"faq/#i-have-no-idea-why-i-am-here","text":"Great!
